## Hello, World!

### Who am I?

My name is Thomas, I'm a french student software engineer @ [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/). I am currently looking for an apprenticeship contract in software development, for a minimum of 6 months. At the end of this apprenticeship, I will attempt to obtain an RNCP6 certification.

### What do I do?

As a student, I'm mainly focused on developing the back-end side of web applications and automations. My main languages are Python 3, JavaScript ES6, HTML5 and CSS3. I am also familiar with C and Bash. I use Debian 11 and Windows 10 as my daily drivers and I have some decent knowledge of macOS.

### Where can I see more of what you do ?

Currently, only my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/tob-0) contains my projects. I am currently working on a more elaborate portofolio and it will soon be available.

## A bit more about me

In addition to computer sciences, I have some other hobbies, including embroidery, sewing, photography.
